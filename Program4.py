## Problem 1 ##
#Please write a script that: 
# - Asks for 2 numbers
# - Prints out those numbers dividing with int division and float division



## Problem 2 ##
#Please write a script that:

#Please rewrite this script so that it only uses 2 variables. It should retain its original behavior 
number1 = int(input("First number: "))
number2 = int(input("Second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Third number: "))

sum = number1 + number2 + number3
print(f"The sum of the numbers: {sum}")


## Problem 4 ##
#Please write a program that:
